# Brew

> I think brew is the best package manager for MacOS (or Linux).

### Install / Uninstall

If you wanna install it, the best way is through the official website : https://brew.sh/

And the install command is very simple as followed and use `brew` to check is successful : 

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

However if you download it without VPN, which may cause failure and make some troubles when download again.

I suggested that use yourself VPN to install brew, and if you unfortunately have installed without VPN,

you can use uninstall command to uninstall brew (https://github.com/homebrew/install#uninstall-homebrew) : 

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh)"`

----

### Notice

When you have finished the install command, please pay attention to the end of details of log in the terminal,

which also has some commands  to invoked, and it will recommand you to install gcc .etc.
